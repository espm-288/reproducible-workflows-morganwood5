## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#don't do rm(list=ls())
#don't do setwd it will exist only on machine if you want to clone its annoying to reproduce 
#for projects^ don't need project does these already better
#click turn off don't restore .r data in tools global general 
1 + 1
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

#usethis::use_github_action("render-rmarkdown.yaml")  try to not leave in markdown it is creating infrastructure normally do in console leaving for reference 



```
You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

mtcars |> ggplot(aes(cyl, mpg)) + geom_point()
```
